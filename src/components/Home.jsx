          In addition to my front-end development expertise, I am deeply
          intrigued by the potential of artificial intelligence, particularly
          generative AI. This interest has led me to explore how AI can be
          integrated into web applications to create smarter, more adaptive user
          experiences. From chatbots and recommendation systems to AI-driven
          design tools, I am committed to harnessing the power of AI to push the
          boundaries of what's possible in web development.
